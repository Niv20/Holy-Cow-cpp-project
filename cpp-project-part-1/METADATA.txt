  || SCREEN FILE METADATA DOCUMENTATION  (__) 
  ||------------------------------------||    

Metadata is placed at the END of a .screen file, after the visual game content.
The metadata section starts with a special separator line:

    === METADATA ===

After this line, you can write metadata commands:


1. ROOM CONNECTIONS (CONNECT)
─────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines where the player goes when exiting the current room.

Format:
    CONNECT <DIRECTION> <ROOM_NUMBER>

Directions:
    - LEFT   - Exit from the left side of the screen
    - RIGHT  - Exit from the right side of the screen
    - UP     - Exit from the top of the screen
    - DOWN   - Exit from the bottom of the screen

Room Numbers:
    - 0, 1, 2, 3... (matches the number in the filename adv-world_XX.screen)

Examples:
    CONNECT RIGHT 1     # Going right leads to room 1
    CONNECT LEFT 0      # Going left leads to room 0
    CONNECT UP 3        # Going up leads to room 3
    CONNECT DOWN 4      # Going down leads to room 4


2. SPECIAL DOORS (DOOR, KEYS, SWITCH, TARGET)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines special doors (■) that require keys and/or switch combinations.

Format:
    DOOR <X> <Y>                    # Door position on screen
    KEYS <key1> <key2> ...          # Required keys (lowercase letters)
    SWITCH <X> <Y> <STATE>          # Required switch position and state
    TARGET <ROOM> <X> <Y>           # Teleport destination (optional)
    ---                             # End of door definition

Parts Explained:

    DOOR <X> <Y>
        - X = horizontal position (0-79)
        - Y = vertical position (0-24)
        - This is where the special door (■) is located on the screen

    KEYS <key1> <key2> ...
        - List of lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.)
        - Player must collect these keys to open the door
        - Keys are lowercase letters on the map
        - Doors are the matching uppercase letters (A, B, C, etc.)

    SWITCH <X> <Y> <STATE>
        - X, Y = position of the switch (0 or 1 on the map)
        - STATE = required state (0 = off, 1 = on)
        - Player must set all switches to correct states
        - Can have multiple SWITCH lines for one door

    TARGET <ROOM> <X> <Y>
        - ROOM = room number to teleport to
        - X, Y = position to teleport to in that room
        - This is optional - only use if door teleports player

    ---
        - Three dashes mark the end of the door definition
        - Required if you have more content after the door

Example (Door requiring keys c, o, w and specific switch states):
    DOOR 31 18
    KEYS c o w
    SWITCH 31 2 0
    SWITCH 31 6 0
    SWITCH 31 10 1
    SWITCH 31 14 1
    ---


3. DARK ZONES (DARK, DARKZONES, ZONE)
─────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines rectangular areas that are dark and require a torch (!) to see.
    There are two ways to define dark zones:

METHOD 1 - Single Dark Zone:
    DARK <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>

    - X1, Y1 = top-left corner of the dark area
    - X2, Y2 = bottom-right corner of the dark area

METHOD 2 - Multiple Dark Zones:
    DARKZONES
    ZONE <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>
    ZONE <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>
    ...
    ---

    - DARKZONES starts the multi-zone block
    - Each ZONE defines one rectangular area
    - You can have as many ZONE lines as you need
    - --- ends the block

How Dark Zones Work:
    - Areas inside dark zones show darkness characters
    - Players need a torch (!) to see and navigate
    - Torch creates light in a radius around the player:
        - Distance 0-2: Full visibility
        - Distance 3: Light shade
        - Distance 4: Medium shade
        - Distance 5: Heavy shade
        - Distance 6+: Complete darkness

Example:
    DARKZONES
    ZONE 14 5 78 15
    ZONE 23 1 78 4
    ---

4. COMMENTS
───────────
Purpose: 
    Add notes that will be ignored by the game.

Format:
    # Your comment text here

Comments can be placed anywhere in the metadata section.
They help explain what the metadata does.

Example:
    # Room 0 connections
    CONNECT RIGHT 1
    CONNECT LEFT 6

    # Special door requiring keys c, o, w
    DOOR 31 18
    KEYS c o w
