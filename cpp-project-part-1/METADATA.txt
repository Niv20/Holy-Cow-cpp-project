  || SCREEN FILE METADATA DOCUMENTATION  (__) 
  ||------------------------------------||    

Metadata is placed at the END of a .screen file, after the visual game content.
The metadata section starts with a special separator line:

    === METADATA ===

After this line, you can write metadata commands:


1. ROOM CONNECTIONS (CONNECT)
─────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines where the player goes when exiting the current room.

Format:
    CONNECT <DIRECTION> <ROOM_NUMBER>

Directions:
    - LEFT   - Exit from the left side of the screen
    - RIGHT  - Exit from the right side of the screen
    - UP     - Exit from the top of the screen
    - DOWN   - Exit from the bottom of the screen

Room Numbers:
    - 0, 1, 2, 3... (matches the number in the filename adv-world_XX.screen)

Examples:
    CONNECT RIGHT 1     # Going right leads to room 1
    CONNECT LEFT 0      # Going left leads to room 0
    CONNECT UP 3        # Going up leads to room 3
    CONNECT DOWN 4      # Going down leads to room 4


2. SPECIAL DOORS (DOOR, KEYS, SWITCH, TARGET)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines special doors (■) that require keys and/or switch combinations.

Format:
    DOOR <X> <Y>                    # Door position on screen
    KEYS <key1> <key2> ...          # Required keys (lowercase letters)
    SWITCH <X> <Y> <STATE>          # Required switch position and state
    TARGET <ROOM> <X> <Y>           # Teleport destination (optional)
    ---                             # End of door definition

Parts Explained:

    DOOR <X> <Y>
        - X = horizontal position (0-79)
        - Y = vertical position (0-24)
        - This is where the special door (■) is located on the screen

    KEYS <key1> <key2> ...
        - List of lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.)
        - Player must collect these keys to open the door
        - Keys are lowercase letters on the map
        - Doors are the matching uppercase letters (A, B, C, etc.)

    SWITCH <X> <Y> <STATE>
        - X, Y = position of the switch (0 or 1 on the map)
        - STATE = required state (0 = off, 1 = on)
        - Player must set all switches to correct states
        - Can have multiple SWITCH lines for one door

    TARGET <ROOM> <X> <Y>
        - ROOM = room number to teleport to
        - X, Y = position to teleport to in that room
        - This is optional - only use if door teleports player

    ---
        - Three dashes mark the end of the door definition
        - Required if you have more content after the door

Example (Door requiring keys c, o, w and specific switch states):
    DOOR 31 18
    KEYS c o w
    SWITCH 31 2 0
    SWITCH 31 6 0
    SWITCH 31 10 1
    SWITCH 31 14 1
    ---


3. PRESSURE BUTTONS (PBUTTON, CLEAR)
────────────────────────────────────
Purpose:
    Defines '$' pressure buttons that clear specific walls ONLY while you stand on them.

Format:
    PBUTTON <X> <Y>
    CLEAR <X1> <Y1>
    CLEAR <X2> <Y2>
    ...             # one CLEAR line per wall to remove
    ---             # end of this pressure button definition

Parts Explained:
    PBUTTON <X> <Y>
        - Position of the '$' tile on the map

    CLEAR <X> <Y>
        - A wall position to temporarily erase while someone stands on the button
        - Add as many CLEAR lines as needed

Example (a button at 40,12 that clears two walls):
    PBUTTON 40 12
    CLEAR 10 5
    CLEAR 12 5
    ---


4. DARK ZONES (DARK, DARKZONES, ZONE)
─────────────────────────────────────
Purpose: 
    Defines rectangular areas that are dark and require a torch (!) to see.
    There are two ways to define dark zones:

METHOD 1 - Single Dark Zone:
    DARK <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>

    - X1, Y1 = top-left corner of the dark area
    - X2, Y2 = bottom-right corner of the dark area

METHOD 2 - Multiple Dark Zones:
    DARKZONES
    ZONE <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>
    ZONE <X1> <Y1> <X2> <Y2>
    ...
    ---

    - DARKZONES starts the multi-zone block
    - Each ZONE defines one rectangular area
    - You can have as many ZONE lines as you need
    - --- ends the block

How Dark Zones Work:
    - Areas inside dark zones show darkness characters
    - Players need a torch (!) to see and navigate
    - Torch creates light in a radius around the player:
        - Distance 0-2: Full visibility
        - Distance 3: Light shade
        - Distance 4: Medium shade
        - Distance 5: Heavy shade
        - Distance 6+: Complete darkness

Example:
    DARKZONES
    ZONE 14 5 78 15
    ZONE 23 1 78 4
    ---


5. MESSAGE BOXES (LINE1, LINE2, LINE3)
──────────────────────────────────────
Purpose:
    Defines text to display in an info box on the screen.
    The box must have a 'T' marker in its top-left corner.
    Text is automatically centered within the box.

Format:
    LINE1 <text>                    # First line of text (top)
    LINE2 <text>                    # Second line of text (middle)
    LINE3 <text>                    # Third line of text (bottom)

Parts Explained:
    LINE1, LINE2, LINE3
        - Each line contains the text to display
        - Text is automatically centered within the box width
        - If text is too long, it gets truncated
        - If text is shorter than width, spaces are added on both sides
        - Empty lines are allowed (just omit the LINE command)

Screen Setup:
    Place a 'T' character in the top-left corner of where text should appear:
    
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │T                                                            │
    │                                                             │
    │                                                             │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    - The 'T' marks where the first line starts. The 'T' itself is removed from the screen when the game loads.
    - The box width is auto-detected by scanning from the 'T' to the right until a `│` character is found.

Example (3-line message):
    LINE1 great news :)
    LINE2 the Key inside the maze opens the door from the first screen.
    LINE3 now the cow that was left behind can be freed.


6. COMMENTS
───────────
Purpose: 
    Add notes that will be ignored by the game.

Format:
    # Your comment text here

Comments can be placed anywhere in the metadata section.
They help explain what the metadata does.

Example:
    # Room 0 connections
    CONNECT RIGHT 1
    CONNECT LEFT 6

    # Special door requiring keys c, o, w
    DOOR 31 18
    KEYS c o w
