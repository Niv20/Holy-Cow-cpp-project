  || FILE 1: adv-world.steps  (__) 
  ||-------------------------||    

The steps file records ONLY player inputs (key presses). It does NOT record 
game events like screen transitions or riddle results - those are computed 
during playback.

Each line has two numbers: CYCLE and KEYCODE.

- CYCLE - The game tick when the key was pressed (integer, starts at 0)
- KEYCODE - ASCII value of the key pressed (integer)

| Key | ASCII Code | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|
| w   | 119        | Player 1 move up |
| s   | 120        | Player 1 move down |
| a   | 97         | Player 1 move left |
| d   | 100        | Player 1 move right |
| i   | 105        | Player 2 move up |
| k   | 107        | Player 2 move down |
| j   | 106        | Player 2 move left |
| l   | 108        | Player 2 move right |
| 1   | 49         | Answer 1 (for riddles) |
| 2   | 50         | Answer 2 (for riddles) |
| 3   | 51         | Answer 3 (for riddles) |
| 4   | 52         | Answer 4 (for riddles) |
| ESC | 27         | Pause menu |

For example:

	# Comments start with #
	# Format: CYCLE KEYCODE

	0 119
	10 97
	15 49
	20 119

  || FILE 2: adv-world.result  (__) 
  ||--------------------------||    

The results file contains expected game events for test verification.
These are the OUTCOMES of gameplay, not inputs.

The format is: CYCLE "description", Where:

- `CYCLE` - The game tick when the event happened
- `description` - Text description in quotes

Here all the event types recorded:

1. **Screen Transitions** - When a player moves to a new screen
   150 "Player 1 moved to screen 2"

2. **Life Lost** - When a player loses a life from bomb explosion
   75 "Player 1 lost a life"
   75 "Player 2 lost a life"
   Note: If both players are hit by the same bomb, both events are recorded.
   Note: Life lost from wrong riddle answer is NOT recorded separately 
         (the riddle answer event already shows it was wrong).

3. **Riddle Answers** - When a player answers a riddle
   15 "Player 1 answered riddle: 2 (CORRECT)"
   20 "Player 1 answered riddle: 1 (WRONG)"

4. **Game End** - When the game ends (win or lose)
   100 "Game ended: WIN with score 150"
   100 "Game ended: LOSE with score 0"

for example:

	12 "Player 1 answered riddle: 1 (WRONG)"
	21 "Player 1 answered riddle: 2 (CORRECT)"
	51 "Game ended: LOSE with score 50"

  || Command Line Usage (__) 
  ||-------------------||    

1. Recording a Game (-save mode): 
	cpp-project.exe -save
- Shows normal menu
- Play the game normally
- When game ends, saves `adv-world.steps` and `adv-world.result`
- Each new game overwrites previous files

2. Replaying a Game: 
	cpp-project.exe -load
- No menu shown
- Reads `adv-world.steps` and replays the inputs
- Shows visual playback (faster than normal)

3. Silent Testing:
	cpp-project.exe -load -silent
- No visual output (fastest)
- Replays inputs from `adv-world.steps`
- Compares actual results with `adv-world.result`
- Prints verification report
- Outputs "TEST PASSED" or "TEST FAILED"

4. Normal Mode (no flags)
	cpp-project.exe
- Standard gameplay with menu
- No recording or playback

  || Verification Report (__) 
  ||--------------------||    

When running the game in silent mode (`-load -silent`), the program compares 
the current gameplay events against the expected events in `adv-world.result`.

The report uses three tags to indicate status:

1. Perfect Match: 
- The event occurred exactly at the expected Cycle with the exact Description.

    [OK]    Cycle 280: Game ended: LOSE with score 50

2. Mismatch: 
An event occurred, but it did not match the recording. This happens if:
- The description is different (Logic change)
- The timing (Cycle) is different (Performance/Speed change)

Example A: Wrong Event Logic
The cycle is correct, but the event is different (Player 1 died instead of Player 2).

    [FAIL]  Event 0:
            Expected: Cycle 49 - Player 2 lost a life
            Actual:   Cycle 49 - Player 1 lost a life
            ^ DESCRIPTION MISMATCH!

Example B: Major Divergence
The game expected a riddle answer, but the game ended instead (due to a bug or code change).

    [FAIL]  Event 1:
            Expected: Cycle 104 - Player 1 answered riddle: 1 (WRONG)
            Actual:   Cycle 280 - Game ended: LOSE with score 0
            ^ CYCLE MISMATCH!
            ^ DESCRIPTION MISMATCH!

3. Missing Event:
The simulation finished (or crashed) before this expected event could happen. 
This usually means the game ended earlier than in the recording.

    [MISS]  Event 2 - Expected but not occurred:
            Cycle 121: Player 1 answered riddle: 2 (CORRECT)
